In the given code the SOQL query is used in loop which is not feasible , because SOQL query executes according to loop 
which may exceeds governor limits for SOQL query .
Also in the given code the DML statement is also used in loop which is also not feasible we have to try to use it once
, so i have optimised the code and used the SOQL once and also use Update DML operation once on the updated list of contacts.
